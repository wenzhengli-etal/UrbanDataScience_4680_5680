## **Course Description**  

Urban data science is an emergent practice in geography and urban planning that combines:  
1) The set of data analysis tools and methods used to understand a wide array of big data and big spatial data sources.  
2) Questions of urban development, structure, complexity, theory, policy, dynamics, and outcomes.  

These approaches enable more spatiotemporally dynamic and granular analyses of cities and allow researchers new insight into urban dynamics.  

This course will provide a toolkit to speak through data, code, statistics, and visualization. Using open-source data and computational tools in Python and the Jupyter Notebook environment, we will learn how to:  
- Design testable research questions  
- Collect and prepare data  
- Apply relevant analytical techniques  
- Present our process and results in an engaging and informative way  
- Identify the limitations of quantitative analysis  

A personal laptop will be required.

## **Learning Objectives and Outcomes**  

The goal of this course is to provide an introduction to a wide range of tools and concepts that will enable future, deeper exploration of urban dynamics. This course provides a ‚Äúsampler‚Äù of the foundations of urban data science through coding, statistical analysis, visualization/narrative-building, and critique.  

The core learning objectives are:  
1. **Use code** to clean, analyze, and visualize spatial data  
2. **Implement a descriptive or predictive analysis** using appropriate data and statistical and/or computational methods  
3. **Clearly communicate your process and results** as a data narrative through visualizations, context, textual description, and presentation  
4. **Identify the limitations and potential biases** in the data, data-generating processes, and tools and methods in addressing your research topic

## **Class Structure**  

### **Weeks 1-13:**  
Each class will include a brief lecture and a tutorial at the end of the class to practice the concept you just learned. There are 4-5 coding homework assignments during this period.  

### **Weeks 14-16:**  
The last three weeks of the class will be devoted to a **final project** of your choosing that addresses an urban development question. The proposals for the project will be due in **Week 10**.  

During **Weeks 14 and 15**, each project group or individual will meet with me to discuss progress, technical or conceptual roadblocks, and next steps. Our last two classes of the semester will be devoted to final presentations.  

üìÖ **Final projects are due on May 16 at 11:59 pm.**

## **Course Prerequisites**  

This course is designed for master‚Äôs students and upper-level undergraduate students.  

- **CRP 4080/5080 (Intro to GIS)** or an equivalent GIS course is a prerequisite.  
- Basic knowledge of **hypothesis testing, basic regression**, and experience with **spreadsheet software (Excel, Google Sheets)** is assumed.
